<div class="justify-text">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), affiliated with the Trustworthy AI Laboratory (TAILab). My research focuses on confidence and uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, with emphasis on conformal prediction & risk control, evidential and Bayesian methods, and information-theoretic uncertainty. I am also interested in LLM uncertainty, calibration, OOD detection, adversarial robustness, and interpretability.

### Research Highlights
- Model uncertainty quantification derived from CP prediction sets.
- OOD detection using information-theoretic and evidential class properties.
- Spatially-adaptive conformal prediction for medical image segmentation.
- Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) for efficient, adaptive prediction sets in deep classification.
- LLM uncertainty quantification using adaptive conformal semantic entropy for prompt-level decision making and response-level prediction sets.
- Adversarial Robustness via diverse ensembles and noisy logits.
