<div class="justify-text">
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), affiliated with the Trustworthy AI Laboratory (TAILab). My research focuses on confidence and uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, with emphasis on conformal prediction & risk control, evidential and Bayesian methods, and information-theoretic uncertainty. I am also interested in LLM uncertainty, calibration, OOD detection, adversarial robustness, and interpretability.

### Research Highlights
- Spatially-adaptive conformal prediction for medical image segmentation (SACP; accepted at MIDL 2025).
- Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) for efficient, adaptive prediction sets in deep classification (COPA 2024).
- Adversarial Robustness via diverse ensembles + noisy logits (ACML 2024).
- Model uncertainty quantification derived from CP prediction sets (AAAI Symposium Series 2023).
