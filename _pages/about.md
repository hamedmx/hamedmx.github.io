I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), affiliated with the Trustworthy AI Laboratory (TAILab). My research focuses on **confidence and uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks**, with emphasis on **conformal prediction & risk control**, **evidential and Bayesian methods**, and **information-theoretic uncertainty**. I am also interested in **LLM uncertainty**, **calibration**, **OOD detection**, **adversarial robustness**, and **interpretability**.

### Research highlights
- **Spatially-adaptive conformal prediction** for medical image segmentation (SACP; accepted at MIDL 2025).
- **Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP)** for efficient, adaptive prediction sets in deep classification (COPA 2024).
- Robustness via **diverse ensembles + noisy logits** (ACML 2024).
- Model uncertainty quantification derived from CP prediction sets (AAAI Symposium Series 2023).
