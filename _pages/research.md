My work centers on **trustworthy AI** with emphasis on uncertainty quantification and **distribution-free reliability guarantees**.

### Themes
- Conformal prediction & risk control
- Evidential/Bayesian deep learning for epistemic uncertainty
- OOD detection & robustness
- Uncertainty in large language models (LLMs)

### Ongoing projects (selected)
- Spatially-adaptive conformal prediction for medical image segmentation (SACP)
- Evidential OOD detection using misclassification cost + information-theoretic regularization
- Adaptive conformal semantic entropy for LLM uncertainty calibration
