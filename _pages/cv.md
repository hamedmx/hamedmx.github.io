## Highlights
- I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering and a Research Assistant at Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), Toronto, ON, Canada. I received my B.Sc. degree from Shahid Beheshti University (2016) and M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran (2019) in Computer Engineering.
- My current research focuses on confidence and uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks, employing techniques such as conformal prediction and risk control, evidential and Bayesian approaches, and information-theoretic methods to enhance reliability in AI systems.
- I have published peer-reviewed research articles in refereed journals and conferences including Expert Systems with Applications (Q1, IF: 8.5), AAAI Human AI Symposium, Conformal and Probabilistic Prediction with Applications (COPA), and Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL).
- Other research interests include uncertainty in large language models (LLMs), adversarial robustness, model calibration, federated learning, and interpretability in machine learning.
