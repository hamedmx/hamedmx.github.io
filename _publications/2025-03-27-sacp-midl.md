While Conformal Prediction provides statistical coverage guarantees, existing nonconformity measures fail to account for spatially varying importance of predictive uncertainty in medical image segmentation. In this paper, we incorporate spatial context near critical interfaces such as a vessel or critical organ in medical image segmentation. Our framework consists of three key components: (1) a base non-conformity score derived from segmentation model probabilities, (2) employing class-conditional calibration followed by a validation mechanism equipped with a distance-weighted scoring function that exponentially decays with distance from key interfaces, and (3) a prediction set construction method that preserves coverage guarantees while providing targeted uncertainty quantification in critical regions. While our approach is generalizable to different scenarios, for validation purposes, we employ tumor segmentation in pancreatic adenocarcinoma imaging from multiple medical centers. Results demonstrate that our method achieves the desired coverage levels while generating prediction sets that adaptively expand near critical interfaces.
