Ontologies are one of the important and effective parts of semantic web which constitute the infrastructure and background knowledge of this realm of web science. Finding valid mappings as much as possible between the concepts or entities of ontologies, especially for the large ones, is a prominent task to align those concepts together and finally merge and integrate their ontologies to make a general and global ontology that is smaller and more flexible in many applications of semantic web. This paper describes a new learning-based ontology mapping method in which inductive logic programming (ILP) is used to learn ontology mapping using information gathered from instances of each entity in order to make some correct and valid alignments between concepts of different ontologies.
